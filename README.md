# Overview
This directory is created to test the actual library. Some guidance has been taken from ["Testing Shared Libraries"](https://medium.com/disney-streaming/testing-jenkins-shared-libraries-4d4939406fa2)

# Setup
In the project root directory:
```
gradle wrapper
```
This will create a few files. Adapt `build.gradle` with proper values.


# Run the tests
In the project root directory:
```
./gradlew test
```
